/**
 * Do the constraints actually say what the schema meant?
 *
 * The unit suite runs with no DATABASE_URL, on purpose — a unit suite that
 * needs a live Postgres is a unit suite that stops being run. So it proves
 * lib/card.ts's in-process fallback and nothing about the SQL. This proves the
 * SQL, against the real database, and the two together cover the path.
 *
 * Everything happens inside a transaction that always rolls back, so running it
 * against production is safe and the last line says so by counting the rows
 * left behind. Statements expected to fail run in a savepoint: in Postgres one
 * error aborts the whole transaction, and every statement after it dies at
 * 25P02 instead of being tested.
