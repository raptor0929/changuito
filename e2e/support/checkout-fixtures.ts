/**
 * The scripted shop that `app-frame-checkout.spec.ts` runs against.
 *
 * This is the first browser mocking in the repo — there was no `page.route`,
 * no MSW and no HAR before it — so the shape is set here deliberately rather
 * than copied from somewhere.
 *
 * ## Why mock at all
 *
 * The flow crosses four things that are not ours and not deterministic: a
 * model, a supermarket, a ledger and a card issuer. Two of them cost money and
 * one of them has no test mode at all. A test that waited on the real four
 * would be measuring their uptime, not our behaviour, and the thing actually
 * worth pinning — that a cart becomes a receipt, exactly once, with the card
 * given back at the end — is entirely on our side of those seams.
 *
 * ## What the mocks are allowed to be
 *
 * Every response here is the shape the real route returns, taken from the
 * exported interface rather than invented: `DepositIntent`, `DepositStatus`,
 * `IssuedCard`, `ThreeDsCode`, `VerifyResponse`. A mock that drifts from its
 * route is a test that passes while the app is broken, so the types are the
 * contract and the fixtures are typed against them where the type is exported.
 *
 * The card numbers are the payment industry's published test PAN. They are
 * fake in the strongest available sense — every processor rejects them — which
 * matters because this file is in a public repo and because one of the
 * assertions in the spec is that they never reach storage.
