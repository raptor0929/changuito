/**
 * What this wallet has bought here.
 *
 * The record behind /mis-compras: one line per order, newest first, read back
 * from the `orders` table rather than from anything the browser kept. That is
 * the point of it — localStorage holds the conversation and the card hint, and
 * both of those are per-device, so a shopper who paid on their phone and opens
 * the laptop has no history at all until this answers.
 *
 * ## POST for a read, again
 *
 * The plan called this `GET /api/orders`, and `POST /api/card/mine` already
 * made this argument: a GET would have to carry the address and the signature
 * in the query string, where they land in access logs, proxy caches and
 * `Referer` headers. A credential belongs in a body, so the verb follows the
 * credential rather than the semantics. Two routes reading with POST for the
 * same reason is a convention; one would have been an oddity.
 *
 * ## Why it takes a signature at all
 *
 * A Stellar address is public. Without a proof, anyone who has ever been paid
 * by this shopper — or who read the ledger — could list what they buy, how
 * much they spend and how often. The `chat` table is narrowed by address in
 * the WHERE clause for exactly that reason, and an order is the same fact with
 * the groceries taken out. `orders` is its own intent: a signature for reading
 * a card cannot list purchases, and one for listing purchases cannot read a
 * card.
 *
 * ## What comes back, and what does not
 *
 * Not the row. `card_id` is left out on purpose — the page has no use for it,
 * `POST /api/card/mine` looks the card up from the *proven* wallet and never
 * takes an id as input, and a value on the wire that nothing consumes is only
 * somewhere for it to leak from. `hasCard` answers the question the page
 * actually asks, which is whether this order ended in a card.
