/**
 * Give back a card that dies with the basket.
 *
 * ## The card this destroys, and the card it must not
 *
 * There are two kinds of card in this app and only one of them belongs to
 * this route. In preview a card is minted per memo, spent once and given back
 * — Vyrion returns any residual to the wallet the moment it dies, and a card
 * left alive is money sitting where nobody is watching it. So the dialog
 * calls this when the shopper says the order is done, when they say it
 * failed, and when they close the tab: the same `finally` shape
 * `ephemeral-card.ts` puts around every payment.
 *
 * In production the card is the customer's. One per wallet, topped up by each
 * deposit, carried between baskets — the whole promise of `keepsOneCard`. And
 * `claimDeposit` writes *that* card's id onto the order, so `heldCard` hands
 * it back here exactly like an ephemeral one. Called unguarded, this route
 * destroyed the kept card every time a checkout dialog closed.
 *
 * Hence `keepsOneCard`, asked before anything is looked up. **Termination of
 * a kept card is never a side effect of leaving a screen.** It is an act the
 * shopper takes deliberately, on /mis-compras, and it costs a signature —
 * `POST /api/card/retire`.
 *
 * ## Why a failed termination freezes
 *
 * Terminating can fail, and what is left behind is a live card with money on
 * it that no part of this app will ever mention again. Freezing it is the
 * strictly better end state: the balance is still returned when somebody
 * terminates it by hand from the dashboard, and in the meantime it cannot be
 * spent. There is nothing to un-freeze it *for* — this card was being
 * destroyed — which is what makes the one-way door acceptable here and not on
 * a card the customer keeps.
 *
 * Safe to call twice, and answers the same way both times. "Already gone" is
 * the outcome the caller wanted, so it is not an error.
