/**
 * The card a deposit pays for — minted, or topped up.
 *
 * The chain of custody is the whole route: a código arrives, the ledger is read
 * for a payment carrying it, the amount comes from that payment, the deposit is
 * claimed exactly once, and a card ends up holding that amount and no more.
 * Nothing in the request body reaches the card except the código — and the
 * código is checked against a public ledger before it buys anything.
 *
 * ## Two cards, because there are two products
 *
 * A preview shopper has no identity, so their card is per-basket: created for
 * this deposit, `spending_limit` equal to it, terminated when they are done.
 * That is the card this route has always made, and it is unchanged.
 *
 * A production shopper has a wallet, and **one card per customer** is the
 * decision — so the second deposit does not mint a second card, it funds the
 * first. `card_owner` holds the binding, `cardOf` reads it, and a deposit that
 * finds a live card calls `fundCard` instead of `createCard`.
 *
 * **The card they keep is created with no `spending_limit`, and that is not a
 * relaxation — it is the only shape that works.** Vyrion sets the limit at
 * creation and exposes no endpoint to raise it, so a standing card born with
 * one could be topped up until the balance hit the limit and then never again:
 * a card that silently stops working on some future shop. The ceiling the
 * limit was carrying moves to the deposit instead, which is where it belongs —
 * `refuseFunding` still bounds every single top-up by `CARD_MAX_CENTS`, and a
 * card can only ever hold what somebody actually sent.
 *
 * `allowedCategories` matters more for the same reason. It is also fixed at
 * creation, and on a card that lives for months it is the one ceiling still
 * doing work every day: a standing balance stays locked to grocery MCCs.
 *
 * ## Claim first, spend second
 *
 * On the top-up path the deposit is claimed **before** `fundCard` is called,
 * which is the reverse of the mint path and deliberate. Funding first would
 * let two tabs both see an unclaimed deposit and both top up — one payment,
 * twice the money. Claiming first can only fail the other way: a deposit
 * marked spent against a card that was not topped up, which is loud in the log
 * and fixed by hand. On the mint path the order cannot be reversed, because
 * the card id does not exist until the card does, so a lost claim there hands
 * the card straight back.
 *
 * ## Why it answers twice with the same card
 *
 * A shopper who refreshes must see the card they already have, not an error
 * about a card they do not remember asking for. So the claim is checked before
 * anything is created, and if a second tab wins the race in between, the card
 * this request made is terminated at once — leaving it alive would strand the
 * money inside it — and the winner's card is returned instead.
 *
 * The response carries the PAN and the CVV, because the shopper has to type
 * them into the súper's form and there is no other way for them to arrive.
 * They are `no-store`, they are never logged, and lib/card.ts says the rest.
 *
 * ## Why this asks for no signature
 *
 * On a gated network `POST /api/deposit` already made the shopper sign, and
 * this route checks that the memo belongs to the wallet that signed. It does
 * **not** ask for a second signature, and that is a decision rather than an
 * omission: a proof lives five minutes (`WALLET_PROOF_TTL_MS`) and a deposit
 * can take longer than that to confirm, so requiring one here would refuse a
 * shopper who has already sent real money — the worst available moment to
 * fail, and one that ends in a refund done by hand.
 *
 * So the memo stays the credential at this step, which is exactly why
 * `mintMemo` draws from the CSPRNG and why lib/card.ts is careful about what
 * the depositor record does and does not prove.
