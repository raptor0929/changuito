/**
 * Give back the card you keep.
 *
 * The other half of `POST /api/card/terminate`, and the reason that route can
 * refuse a kept card at all: destroying the customer's card stops being a
 * side effect of closing a dialog and becomes a thing they ask for, once, on
 * /mis-compras. Vyrion returns any residual balance to the wallet as it dies,
 * so this is how somebody gets their change back and walks away.
 *
 * ## Why this is not `terminate` with a flag
 *
 * `terminate` is keyed by a memo and takes no signature — a checkout dialog
 * closing during an unload has neither an address nor time to ask for one,
 * and it needs neither, because the worst it can do is destroy a card that
 * was minted for that one basket and is about to be abandoned.
 *
 * None of that is true here. The card is days old, the request comes from a
 * device that never paid for it, and it is irreversible. So this route is
 * shaped like `POST /api/card/mine` instead: the address and a fresh SEP-53
 * signature, and **the card id is never an input** — the server looks up
 * which card the proven wallet owns. There is nowhere to put a guessed id.
 *
 * The intent is `retire`, not `card`. Somebody who approved *"ver los datos
 * de mi tarjeta"* did not agree to destroy it, and a signature is only worth
 * asking for if it cannot be spent on something else — the same argument
 * `GET`-shaped `orders` makes against reusing `card`.
 *
 * ## Order of operations
 *
 * Vyrion first, the binding second. A termination that succeeded and a
 * binding that did not is already handled and needs no compensation here:
 * `POST /api/card/mine` reads the card back, sees `terminated`, and drops the
 * row itself. The reverse — unbinding a card that is still alive — would
 * strand a live card with money on it that nothing in this app can name
 * again, so it is the ordering that is load-bearing, not the error handling.
