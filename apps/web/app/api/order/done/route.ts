/**
 * POST /api/order/done — the shopper has their groceries.
 *
 * The last thing that happens to an order, and the only one the browser is
 * trusted to decide. `CheckoutModal`'s `settle()` already files a receipt at
 * exactly this moment; before this route that receipt lived only in
 * localStorage, so /mis-compras — which reads the database — went on listing
 * a finished shop as in flight for ever.
 *
 * ## Why no signature
 *
 * Every other route that takes a memo either moves money or hands back
 * something a stranger would want: `POST /api/card` mints a funded card,
 * `POST /api/orders` lists what somebody buys. This one sets a status. It
 * cannot mark an order paid — `markDone` only moves `paid`/`carded` → `done`
 * and no code path anywhere lets a request choose a status — so the worst a
 * caller who guessed a memo achieves is closing a shop that was already over.
 *
 * Asking for a wallet signature here would cost more than it buys, and not in
 * comfort: a proof lives five minutes, this fires after a checkout that can
 * take longer than that, and the failure mode would be a wallet prompt on top
 * of a receipt. The memo carries what protection is warranted — `mintMemo`
 * draws from the CSPRNG — and `requireHuman` keeps the route off the open
 * internet, the same two things `POST /api/card` relies on for a much larger
 * effect.
 *
 * ## Why preview gets a 200
 *
 * There is no row. Preview never writes to Postgres (lib/app-mode.ts), so
 * "closed" and "there was never anything to close" are the same state, and
 * the browser calls this in both modes because `settle()` does not know which
 * one it is in — nor should it. An error here would be reporting a failure
 * that did not happen, on a request nothing is waiting for.
