/**
 * The two steps between a full basket and a receipt: send the importe, then
 * pay at the store in a frame.
 *
 * ## Why the login is not in the frame
 *
 * A login form inside someone else's chrome is the exact shape of a phishing
 * page, and a shopper has no way to tell ours from a real one. So the frame
 * only ever shows checkout, and "entrar a mi cuenta" opens a top-level tab on
 * the store's own origin — real URL bar, real certificate, and the only place
 * a password manager will offer to fill.
 *
 * ## Why there is always a tab
 *
 * The store's checkout sets a `samesite=none` cookie. Safari blocks those in a
 * third-party frame by default, Firefox partitions them, and Chrome's tracking
 * protection covers a share of users. Neither `requestStorageAccess()` (called
 * by the embedded page) nor `requestStorageAccessFor()` (needs the embedded
 * origin's Permissions-Policy) is ours to grant, so this cannot be fixed from
 * here. "Abrir en una pestaña" is therefore a co-primary path, worded as an
 * equal, not a fallback the shopper reaches after something breaks.
 *
 * ## Why a button says the payment happened
 *
 * The frame is cross-origin. We cannot read its DOM, its URL, or an
 * `orderPlaced` event — that is the browser working correctly. So the shopper
 * tells us, and the server corroborates by re-reading the cart at the store:
 * lib/order-check.ts explains what that can and cannot establish. It is never
 * treated as proof, and a store that disagrees never becomes an accusation —
 * the shopper is the one who was there.
 *
 * ## Why the card is optional
 *
 * The frame is the store's real checkout, so a shopper's own card already
 * works and costs us nothing. The single-use card is for the one who would
 * rather not put theirs into a page they reached through a chat. It is offered
 * only where the deployment can actually mint one — `intent.cardAvailable` —
 * and given back when this dialog closes, because a card left alive is money
 * sitting somewhere nobody is watching.
 *
 * ## Why preview pays with one button
 *
 * A visitor with no session has no wallet, so "send this importe to this
 * address" is an instruction they cannot follow. `POST /api/deposit/demo`
 * signs for them out of the demo wallet, and this dialog offers it as a single
 * button instead of the address-and-memo fields. Nothing after it changes: the
 * same 4s poll sees the same payment land on the same ledger.
 *
 * The button is behind `intent.demoPayable` rather than behind the mode alone,
 * so a deployment with no `DEMO_WALLET_SECRET` falls back to showing the
 * address and the memo. That path is not a demo any more — it is an operator
 * paying by hand — but it works, which is better than a button that 503s.
 *
 * ## Why it signs in modo real
 *
 * On a real network `POST /api/deposit` is a door onto actual USDC, so
 * `lib/deposit-gate.ts` asks the wallet to prove itself before it will hand out
 * an address to pay into. The dialog asks for that signature up front rather
 * than letting the server refuse: `realModeNeedsProof` is shared with the gate
 * so the two cannot disagree about when one is wanted. In modo prueba nothing
 * signs and a guest with no wallet at all shops exactly as before.

/**
 * ## Why production pays with one button too
 *
 * The shopper is signed in, their dollars are in the account they signed in
 * to, and the importe has to reach an address we control. Asking them to copy
 * that address and a código into some other app to move money between two
 * accounts *we* can both see was work the browser could do — and it was the
 * step the flow lost people on, because it is four copies and a network
 * picker before anything happens.
 *
 * So `sendPayment` sends it, with the código attached as MEMO_TEXT, and
 * nothing downstream changes: the same 4s poll reads the same classic payment
 * off the same ledger. `matchDeposit` never asks who sent it.
 *
 * Three things hold this up, and all three are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **The memo.** `options.memo` is the only reason this settles at all. A
 *   payment without it arrives, costs the shopper real money and is never
 *   matched — the código is what ties an importe to this basket and not
 *   another. It is asserted on in lib/test/checkout-modal.test.ts because a
 *   silent regression here is unrecoverable money.
 * - **A `G…` account.** On a passkey smart wallet `sendPayment` becomes a SAC
 *   transfer, which leaves a contract event and no classic payment record, so
 *   the poll would wait for ever. Such a session cannot reach this step anyway
 *   — the deposit gate wants a SEP-53 signature a C-address cannot give — but
 *   the failure would be invisible, so it is guarded here as well.
 * - **The balance, read first.** A short balance is a sentence before the
 *   press rather than `op_underfunded` after it.
 *
 * The address and the código stay on screen, below the button. Somebody whose
 * dollars sit on an exchange still needs them, and that is a different shopper
 * rather than an earlier step in this one's journey — so it is demoted, not
 * deleted, and it disappears once the wallet has actually paid.
 *
 * ## Why `usePollar()` is not called here
 *
 * It throws outside a provider, and there are two places without
 * one: a deployment with no Pollar key, and app/dev/ui, which renders this
 * dialog on its own. The same split WalletWidget and PaymentModal make — but
 * ending in the dialog either way rather than in `null`, because checkout in
 * modo prueba has never needed a wallet and must not start now.
