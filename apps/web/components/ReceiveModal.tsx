/**
 * Where a shopper gets their own address, so somebody can send money to it.
 *
 * Both halves matter and they are for two different people in the same person.
 * The QR is for the one holding a phone with Lemon open, who would otherwise
 * type fifty-six base32 characters into a withdrawal form. The text is for the
 * one on a laptop, who cannot photograph their own screen — and it is the
 * **whole** address, not `GDVS…NEZK`, because a truncated address is a thing
 * you can read and not a thing you can use.
 *
 * The QR encodes the bare address and nothing else. A SEP-7 `web+stellar:`
 * URI carries more — the asset, an amount — and is understood by Stellar
 * wallets, but the scanner this is actually pointed at belongs to an exchange's
 * withdrawal form, which wants a destination and would paste the scheme and
 * the query string into it as if they were part of the account. Bare also means
 * the code and the text below it are the same value, so there is one thing to
 * be right about rather than two.
 *
 * Presentational, like FaucetConfirm: the trustline is opened by a signature
 * from `usePollar()`, and the caller owns that. This gets the state and a
 * callback.
