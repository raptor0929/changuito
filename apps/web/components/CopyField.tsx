 * A label, a value the shopper has to retype somewhere else, and a button that

 * deposit step for the address and the código, the card panel for the número
 * and the CVV — and importing one from the other would make a cycle out of a
 * twenty-line component.
 *
 * The copy state lives here rather than in either parent: "Copiado" is about
 * this field and nothing else, and hoisting it produced a parent that had to
 * remember which of five fields was briefly green.
