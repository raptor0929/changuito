/**
 * Opens the history drawer. Lives in the masthead, beside the brand.
 *
 * It used to be `position: fixed` in the top-left corner, which put a 44px
 * button exactly on top of the brand mark at every width below the wide
 * breakpoint — measured at 390px and 768px, both a direct overlap. A floating
 * handle also has nowhere to go that the composer, the footer or the dev
 * overlay do not already occupy. In the masthead it is in the flow, it moves
 * with the 560px block, and it is the first thing after the skip link in tab
 * order, which is where a navigation control belongs.
 *
 * Hidden at the wide breakpoint: there the rail is a permanent column, and a
 * button that opens what is already open is a dead end.
