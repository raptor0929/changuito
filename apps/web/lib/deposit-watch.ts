/**
 * The first payment that satisfies every condition, or null.
 *
 * All five conditions are load-bearing:
 *
 * - **type** — only a `payment`. A `create_account` moves XLM too and its
 *   record spells the amount `starting_balance`, so accepting it would read
 *   `undefined` as the amount.
 * - **to** — paid *to* the deposit account. The same stream carries what the
 *   account sends out, and an outgoing payment carrying the shopper's memo is
 *   a refund, not a deposit.
 * - **asset** — exact. Native is matched by `asset_type`, because a native
 *   record carries no code and no issuer; anything else has to match both
 *   code and issuer. Code alone is not enough — "USDC" is a string anyone can
 *   issue, and an asset with the right code and a stranger's issuer is a
 *   different asset that happens to look like money.
 * - **memo** — exact, case-sensitive, `memo_type: 'text'`. The alphabet is
 *   uppercase-only (see deposit.ts) so a case-insensitive compare would only
 *   ever loosen it.
 * - **amount** — at least what was quoted. Compared in integer stroops rather
 *   than as floats: `0.1 + 0.2 > 0.3` is true in binary floating point, and a
 *   comparison that is wrong in the seventh decimal of somebody's money is
 *   not a rounding detail.
 *
 * A failed transaction never reaches here — Horizon only records operations of
 * successful ones — but `successful === false` is rejected anyway, because
 * relying on an upstream invariant we do not control costs one line to avoid.
 *
 * Every one of these was exercised against live testnet Horizon with a real
 * memo payment before it was written down; see lib/test/deposit-watch.test.ts,
 * whose fixture is that transaction's actual record.
