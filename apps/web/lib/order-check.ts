/**
 * What a cart looks like from outside it.
 *
 * The checkout runs in a cross-origin frame, so the app cannot read a single
 * thing about it: not the DOM, not the URL, not whether the order went
 * through. This is the way around that wall — VTEX's *public* orderForm
 * endpoint, read server-side, which answers a few narrow questions about the
 * cart id we already hold.
 *
 * ## What it can and cannot tell us, verified by hand on 2026-09-25
 *
 * Against `diaonline.supermercadosdia.com.ar`, with no cookies:
 *
 * - `loggedIn` is **always false for us**, and it is not a bug. It describes
 *   the session making the request, not the cart, and our request has no
 *   session. Anything keyed on it would be keyed on a constant.
 * - `clientProfileData` **does** persist on the cart and **is** readable
 *   anonymously. A brand-new orderForm returns `null`; once a profile is
 *   attached it comes back populated. That is the usable signal, and it is
 *   what `identified` reports.
 * - It came back **unmasked** — a full email, and the same document that the
 *   shopper typed. So the cart id is a stronger bearer credential than the
 *   "anyone can edit this basket" we already knew about: anyone holding it can
 *   read the shopper's name, email and DNI once they have logged in.
 *
 * Two rules fall out of that last point, and they are the reason this module
 * exists rather than the route calling `fetch` itself:
 *
 * 1. **The profile never leaves this function.** `identified` is a boolean. The
 *    object is read, tested for null, and dropped. Nothing returns it, logs it
 *    or stores it, so there is no path by which a DNI reaches our logs.
 * 2. **`identified` is a hint, never proof.** The same endpoint accepts an
 *    anonymous *write* of `clientProfileData` — it answered 200 to one. So it
 *    is good enough to decide which button to emphasise and not good enough to
 *    decide that someone paid. Payment is `looksPaid`, and even that is
 *    circumstantial; see below.
 *
 * A third thing, found by asking for a cart id that was never issued: VTEX
 * answers 200 and hands back an empty cart bearing that id. There is no such
 * thing as a 404 here, so "the store does not know this cart" is not an answer
 * this endpoint can give, and nothing may be inferred from a cart being empty
 * on its own.

  /** A profile is attached to this cart. A hint about login, never the profile. */

  /**
   * The signature of a finished checkout: the cart had items, it has none
   * now, and a profile is attached to it. VTEX empties an orderForm when its
   * order is placed, and it will not take an order without a profile.
   *
   * All three conditions are needed, and the third one was learned the hard
   * way. Asking VTEX for an orderForm id that **never existed** returns 200,
   * with that same id, zero items and a zero value — it materialises any
   * 32-hex string as a fresh empty cart. So "had items, has none" alone calls
   * a fabricated id paid. `clientProfileData` is what tells the two apart: a
   * cart nobody ever used has none.
   *
   * It is still circumstantial and the copy must not pretend otherwise. A
   * shopper who logged in and then emptied their own basket by hand produces
   * exactly this. It is checked because the alternative — writing a receipt
   * purely because a button was pressed — takes the browser's word for a
   * purchase, and this at least makes the store agree that something happened
   * to a cart that a real person had been using.
