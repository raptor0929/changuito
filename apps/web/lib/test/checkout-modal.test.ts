/**
 * Read as text, not rendered.
 *
 * This suite is `node --experimental-strip-types --test` over `lib/test/*.ts`:
 * there is no DOM, no React renderer and no TSX in it, so a behavioural test
 * of CheckoutModal is not on the table here. What *is* on the table is pinning
 * the handful of lines inside it whose absence would be silent, and that is
 * worth more than it sounds — the precedent is
 * apps/landing/lib/test/brand-lockup.test.ts, which reads a page's source for
 * the same reason.
 *
 * Only facts that a regression would hide belong here. Everything about the
 * one-click payment either works or throws in the shopper's face, except the
 * memo — a payment sent without it succeeds on the ledger, takes real money,
 * and is then never matched to the basket it was for. There is no error, no
 * log and nothing to refund from, which is precisely why it is asserted on a
 * level this crude rather than left to a browser test that does not exist.
