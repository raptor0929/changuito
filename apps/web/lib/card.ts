/**
 * The single-use card the shopper types into the súper's own payment form.
 *
 * The shopper can always pay with their own card — the frame is the store's
 * real checkout and nothing here is required. This is the other option: a
 * card funded with exactly this basket, usable once, terminated after.
 *
 * ## What stops anyone minting one
 *
 * Nothing the browser says. `POST /api/card` takes a código, re-reads the
 * ledger for a payment carrying it, and derives the amount **from the payment
 * that actually landed** — never from the request body. A figure sent by a
 * client is a figure a client chose.
 *
 * Then it is claimed exactly once. A deposit that already bought a card cannot
 * buy a second, and the claim is a conditional UPDATE — `where card_id is null`
 * — rather than a read followed by a write, because two tabs pressing the
 * button together is the ordinary case and not the adversarial one. It was a
 * Redis SETNX until the card became something the shopper keeps; see the note
 * above `rememberDepositor` for why a latch with an expiry was the wrong shape
 * for money.
 *
 * ## What is never written down
 *
 * The PAN and CVV go from Vyrion to the shopper's screen and stop there. Not
 * a log line, not localStorage, not a Playwright trace — `e2e/app-auth.spec.ts`
 * already turns traces off for this repo because it is public, and this is the
 * reason that matters most. `VyrionClient.cardDetails` registers both with the
 * redactor on arrival, so even a careless `log()` elsewhere cannot print them.

/**
 * All of this used to be two Redis keys with a 24h expiry, and the expiry was

 * that confirmed slowly outlived it and became an unowned memo, which is a 403
 * to somebody who has already sent real money. `chg:card:*` was the claim
 * latch; Redis can evict under memory pressure, and an evicted latch mints a
 * second card against a deposit that already bought one.
 *
 * Both are columns on `orders` now. The once-only guarantee that `SET NX` gave
 * becomes `where card_id is null` in an UPDATE — the same atomicity, because
 * the first transaction's commit makes the second's predicate false — and it
 * leaves a row behind, so "which deposit paid for which card" is answerable a
 * month later rather than a day.
 *
 * **The in-process fallback stays.** Not as a second-class path: it is what
 * lets a fresh clone with no DATABASE_URL still run the demo, the same degrade
 * turn-store.ts makes, and it is what the unit tests exercise since they run
 * with no database reachable. A single instance still refuses a second card for
 * the same deposit; what it cannot do is survive a restart, which is why it is
 * not what production uses.
