/**
 * The one reply that does not need a model.
 *
 * Every basket starts with the same question. The prompt tells the model that
 * without a supermarket and a postal code it must ask for them before
 * anything else, and it does — but on the local model that single sentence
 * took 41.7s on production, most of it prompt evaluation over twelve tool
 * schemas, with nothing on screen. A guest tapping a starter chip is the
 * common first turn, so the common first impression was a stalled spinner.
 *
 * So the first message of a conversation that names no postal code is
 * answered here, instantly, with the question the model would have asked.
 * It is written into history like any other reply, so the next turn's model
 * sees the user's original request, then this question, then their answer.
 *
 * Deliberately narrow: only the first message, only with no location set,
 * and only when nothing in it looks like a postal code. Anything else — a
 * follow-up, "no sé", a CPA, a number that might be one — goes to the model,
 * which is what happened before for every message.
 *
 * No imports, so it loads under `node --experimental-strip-types`.
